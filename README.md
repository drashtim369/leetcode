# LeetCode Solutions

Collection of LeetCode questions solved in C++ to strengthen problem-solving skills and ace coding interviews.

## Overview

This repository contains solutions for popular LeetCode problems, covering:

* Arrays
* Hashing
* Two Pointers
* Sorting
* Bit Manipulation
* And more…

Each solution is organized in its own folder named with the **problem number and title**, following this format:

```
<problem-number>-<problem-title>
```

Example:

```
0026-remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array
0027-remove-element
0066-plus-one
0268-missing-number
0283-move-zeroes
```

## Folder Structure

```

├── 0066-plus-one/
├── 0268-missing-number/
├── 0283-move-zeroes/
└── README.md
```

* Each folder contains a C++ solution file (`.cpp`) that has been tested on LeetCode.
* Solutions are **optimized** for time and space complexity wherever applicable.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
